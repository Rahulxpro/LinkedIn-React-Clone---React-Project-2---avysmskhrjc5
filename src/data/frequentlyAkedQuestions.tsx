    ques: "What should I know about InMail credits, job credits, profile viewers, and people browsing?",
    ans: "InMail credits expire after 90 days. If you cancel your upgraded account, any unused InMail credits will be valid only until the end of your current billing cycle. If you cancel your Recruiter Lite or Recruiter Corporate account, any unused job credits you have will be transferred to your personal LinkedIn.com account at the end of your current billing cycle. For Who’s Viewed Your Profile, first and last name may not be listed for profile viewers who have chosen to remain semi- or fully-anonymous via their privacy settings. Certain search and browsing restrictions apply if an unusually high number of queries are executed in a short time period, in order to prevent system abuse.",
